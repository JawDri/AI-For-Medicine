Medical treatment may impact patients differently based on their existing health conditions. 
In this final course, we’ll estimate treatment effects using data from randomized control trials and applying tree-based models. 
In the second week, we’ll apply machine learning interpretation methods to explain the decision-making of complex machine learning models.
In the final week of this course, we’ll use natural language entity extraction and question-answering methods to automate the task of labeling medical datasets.
